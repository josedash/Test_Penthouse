# Test_Penthouse

My approach for builidng a test_suite/framework are two things.

1. Prioritize re-usability over complexity.
2. Transparency over levels of testing so you can see the connections between <br />
   Components(small) <- integrations(mediums) <- multiple integrations/e2e (large) testing.
